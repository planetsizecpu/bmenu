# bmenu

Menu manager for shell, this is a shell script I made in 1992 when Unix(R) systems dominated the world, now it is no longer maintained.

By default it opens the menu file "menu.m"

*** Menu files consist of: ***

TITLE HEADER LINE (must be the first line)

any number of line pairs with:

a first line with a option number plus a comma plus the option title a second line with a unix command line or the "menu" word followed with a menu file-name (.m extension)

No white lines are supported Look at the example please
