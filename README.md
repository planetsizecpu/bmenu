# bmenu

Basical menu manager for Linux/AIX shell, this is a shell script I wrote in 1992 when Unix(R) systems dominated the world, it is fully compatible with SculptorÂ® 4gl 1.2 menu system files, but now it is no longer maintained.

By default it opens the menu file "menu.m"

*** Menu files consist of: ***

TITLE HEADER LINE (must be the first line)

any number of line pairs with:

A first line with a option number plus a comma plus the option title. 
A second line with a Unix command line or the "menu" word followed with a menu file-name (.m extension not needed)

No white lines are allowed or will fail.

*** EXAMPLE ***

MAIN MENU OPTIONS

1,PROCESS STATUS

ps -ef | more

2,PRINTER STATUS

lpstat ; read x

3,NET OPTIONS
